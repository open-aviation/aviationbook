The elements presented in this section are mainly taken from the \acr{ICAO}
 Standard Atmosphere Manual,
and the revised atmosphere model [@ATMORev] used in the Eurocontrol \acr{BADA}
 performance model.

## The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) {#sect:ISA}


### The Hydrostatic Equation

$$ -dp= \rho g dh
$$ {#eq-FLUIDOSTATIC}

where $\rho$ is the air density.

### The Ideal Gaz Law

$$ p= \rho R  T
$$ {#eq-PERFECT_GAS}

In this equation, $R$ is the specific constant for dry air
($R= 287.05287\quad m^2/K.s^2$), and $T$ is the air temperature.

### The Geopotential Altitude

In @eq-FLUIDOSTATIC, the acceleration $g=g(h)$ due to the
combined effects of Earth gravitation and rotation varies with the
altitude $h$. Depending on the chosen Earth model, the expression of
$g(h)$ can be more or less complex.

To simplify the expression of the atmospheric model equations, we
introduce a new quantity, the geopotential altitude $H$, defined by
@eq-GEOPOTENTIAL_ALTITUDE, where $g_0 = 9.80665\quad m/s^2$
is the reference value for the gravity of Earth, taken at the mean sea
level at a reference latitude.

$$ gdh = g_0dH
$$ {#eq-GEOPOTENTIAL_ALTITUDE}

### Characteristics of the Standard Atmosphere at Mean Sea Level

The main characteristics of the ISA atmosphere at mean sea level are
shown in @tbl-ISA_AT_MSL.

  Earth gravity          $g_0= 9,80665$    \[m/s$^2$\]
  ---------------------- ----------------- --------------
  Atmospheric pressure   $p_0= 101325$     \[Pa\]

### Temperature as a Function of Geopotential Altitude

The temperature is a piecewise linear function of the geopotential
altitude.

$$ T= T_b + \beta_b(H-H_b)
$$ {#eq-TEMPERATURE_ISA}

The different atmospheric layers, with the values of the temperature
gradient up to the altitude of 80 km, are described in @tbl-ISA_LAYERS.
Note that @eq-TEMPERATURE_ISA can be used for negative altitudes, with the parameters of the layer $0$.

  ------------------ ------------------------- -------------- --------------------- --------------

  (80 km). {#tbl-ISA_LAYERS}

Commercial aviation is concerned by the first two layers, in the
troposphere and the beginning of the stratosphere. The troposphere and
the stratosphere are separated by an isobaric surface, the tropopause,
at $11$ km altitude.

### Atmospheric pressure {#sect:PRESSION_ISA}

@eq-PERFECT_GAS gives us an expression for the air density
$\rho= \frac{p}{RT}$ which can be replaced in @eq-FLUIDOSTATIC, by introducing the geopotential
altitude (see @eq-GEOPOTENTIAL_ALTITUDE).

$$dp= -\rho g dh= -\rho g_0dH= - \frac{g_0}{RT}pdH
$$

Taking into account the expression of @eq-TEMPERATURE_ISA in the altitude layer (numbered $b$)
where we are located, we obtain:

$$%\begin{aligned}
\frac{dp}{p} =  - \frac{g_0}{RT}dH = - \left(\frac{g_0}{R}\right)\frac{dH}{T_b + \beta_b(H-H_b)}
% =  - \frac{g_0}{R \beta_b} \left(\frac{\beta_b dH}{T_b + \beta_b(H-H_b)}\right)
%\end{aligned}
$$

This leads to two possible expressions of the pressure as a function of
the geopotential altitude, depending on the value of the temperature
gradient:

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_b \neq 0 & \quad\quad \ln\frac{p}{p_b} = - \frac{g_0}{R \beta_b} \ln\left(\frac{T_b + \beta_b(H-H_b)}{T_b}\right)\\
\beta_b=0 & \quad\quad \ln\frac{p}{p_b} = - \frac{g_0}{R T_b}(H-H_b)\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-LOG_PRESSURE}

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_b \neq 0 & \quad\quad p =  p_b\left[\frac{T_b + \beta_b(H-H_b)}{T_b}\right]^{- \frac{g_0}{R \beta_b}}\\
\beta_b=0 & \quad\quad p =p_b \exp\left[- \frac{g_0}{R T_b}(H-H_b)\right]\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-PRESSURE_ISA}

### Geopotential Altitude as a Function of Atmospheric Pressure

Conversely, starting from @eq-LOG_PRESSURE, we can easily express the geopotential altitude $H$ as a function of the atmospheric pressure.

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_b \neq 0 & \quad\quad H=  H_b + \frac{T_b}{\beta_b}\left[\left(\frac{p}{p_b}\right)^{- \frac{R \beta_b}{g_0}} -1\right]\\
\beta_b=0 & \quad\quad H =H_b - \frac{R T_b}{g_0}\ln\left(\frac{p}{p_b}\right)\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-GEOPOTENTIAL_ALTITUDE_ISA}

### Air Density as a Function of Geopotential Altitude

The density of air is simply expressed from @eq-PERFECT_GAS.

$$ \rho= \frac{p}{RT}
$$ {#eq-RHO_ISA}

It is expressed as a function of geopotential altitude by replacing
pressure and temperature by their
expressions from @eq-PRESSURE_ISA and @eq-TEMPERATURE_ISA. We then find @{eq-DENSITY_ISA}, where $\rho_b= \frac{p_b}{RT_b}$ is the air
density at the base of the considered altitude layer.

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_b \neq 0 & \quad\quad \rho =  \rho_b\left[\frac{T_b + \beta_b(H-H_b)}{T_b}\right]^{- \frac{g_0}{R \beta_b}-1}\\
\beta_b=0 & \quad\quad \rho =\rho_b \exp\left[- \frac{g_0}{R T_b}(H-H_b)\right]\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-DENSITY_ISA}

### Speed of Sound

The speed of sound in air is given by the following equation, where
$\kappa = 1.4$ for air :

$$ a= \sqrt{\kappa RT}
$$ {#eq-SOUND_ISA}



## Non-ISA atmospheres for Altimetry

In general, the real atmosphere does not satisfy the assumptions of the
International Standard Atmosphere (ISA). An atmosphere can be non-ISA in
many different ways. First of all, it is not always composed of dry air
only. Also, the temperature and pressure conditions at sea level and/or
the temperature gradient may be different from those defined by the
standard atmosphere.

For the measurement of aircraft altitude, however, relatively simple
assumptions about the atmosphere are made, using the notion of pressure
altitude, which we will detail in the rest of this section.

### Concept of Pressure Altitude

Let $p$ be the pressure at geopotential altitude $H$, in the non-ISA
atmosphere modeled in this section. The *geopotential pressure altitude*
(or simply *pressure altitude*) is defined as the geopotential altitude
at which the pressure $p$ would be measured if the atmosphere were
standard.

The pressure altitude is denoted $H_P$. Note that, by definition, the
isobar $p=p_0= 1013.25$ it hPa corresponds to a zero pressure altitude
($H_p=0$).

### Hydrostatic Equilibrium, Law of Perfect Gases, Humidity

For altimetry purposes, the non-ISA atmosphere modeled in this section
is assumed to be at hydrostatic equilibrium, and to follow the law of
perfect gases. The humidity of the air is not taken into account, as in
the ISA model. @eq-FLUIDOSTATIC and @eq-PERFECT_GAS which were made for the ISA model remain valid, with the same specific constant $R$ for air.

### Assumptions on Temperature Gradient

The following assumptions are made about the temperature profile, with
respect to the altimetry requirements:

-   the layers of atmosphere are defined in pressure altitude $H_p$, and
    not in geopotential altitude $H$[^1]. For aviation purposes, we only
    consider the two lowest layers : the troposphere, and the
    stratosphere, separated by the tropopause located at the pressure
    altitude given
    by @eq-Hp_TROPOPAUSE:
    $$ H_{p,\text{trop}}=11000\quad m$$ {#eq-Hp_TROPOPAUSE}

-   the temperature depends linearly on *pressure altitude* (i.e. the
    altitude that would be observed if the atmosphere were ISA), with
    the following gradient:
    $$ \begin{aligned}
    &\frac{dT}{dH_p} = & -6.5\quad\text{K/km}\quad\quad\text{for}\quad H_p<H_{p,\text{trop}} \\
    & & 0 \quad\text{K/km} \quad\quad\text{for}\quad H_p \geq H_{p,\text{trop}}\\
    \end{aligned}$$ {#eq-TEMPERATURE_GRADIENT}

In the following, we will denote $\beta$ the numerical constant of the
temperature gradient in the troposphere:

$$ \beta=-6.5\quad\text{K/m}
$$ {#eq-beta}

### Temperature and "ISA Temperature" {#sect:TEMPERATURE_IN_NON_ISA}

Let $T$ be the temperature at a given point in the atmosphere located at
a pressure altitude $H_p$. We will denote $T_{\mathit{\tiny ISA}}$ the
temperature that we would have observed at the same pressure altitude
(and thus at the same pressure) if the atmosphere had been standard.

According to the assumptions made in this section, in each layer of the
atmosphere, the temperature is a linear function of the pressure
altitude, with an identical temperature gradient for $T$ and
$T_{\mathit{\tiny ISA}}$. Consequently, the difference between $T$ and
$T_{\mathit{\tiny ISA}}$ remains constant whatever the pressure
altitude $H_p$, at the vertical of a given geographical point. We will
denote $\Delta T$ this difference.

$$ T= T_{\mathit{\tiny ISA}} + \Delta T
$$ {#eq-DEF_DELTA_T}

Taking the isobar $p=p_0$ as the troposphere base, the temperature
profiles for $T$ and $T_{\text{\tiny ISA}}$ are expressed as follows in
@eq-TEMP_HP, where the pressure altitude of the tropopause
is given by @eq-Hp_TROPOPAUSE.

$$\begin{aligned}
&T= T_0 + \Delta T + \beta H_p & \quad\quad\text{for}\quad H_p<H_{p,\mathit{trop}} \\
&T_{\mathit{trop}} = T_0 + \Delta T + \beta H_{p,{\mathit{trop}}} & \quad\quad\text{à la tropopause}\\
&T= T_{\mathit{trop}} &  \quad\quad\text{for}\quad H_p \geq H_{p,\mathit{trop}}\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-TEMP_HP}

$$\begin{aligned}
&T_{\mathit{\tiny ISA}}= T_0 + \beta H_p & \quad\quad\text{for}\quad H_p<H_{p,\mathit{trop}} \\
&T_{\mathit{\tiny ISA},\mathit{trop}} = T_0 + \beta H_{p,{\mathit{trop}}} =216,65\quad K & \quad\quad\text{à la tropopause}\\
&T_{\mathit{\tiny ISA}}= T_{\mathit{\tiny ISA},\mathit{ trop}} &  \quad\quad\text{for}\quad H_p \geq H_{p,\mathit{ trop}}\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-TEMP_ISA_HP}

### Reference Altitudes and Levels in Altimetry

#### The isobar $p=p_0=1013.25$ it hPa (StdRef)

By definition of pressure altitude, the isobar *StdRef* is at pressure
altitude $H_p=0$. Its temperature (at a given geographical point) can
differ from the ISA conditions by a $\Delta T$ difference.

$$\begin{aligned}
&p_{\mathit \tiny StdRef}= p_0\\
&T_{\mathit \tiny StdRef}= T_0 + \Delta T\\
&T_{\mathit \tiny ISA, StdRef}= T_0\\
&H_{p,{\mathit \tiny StdRef}} = 0\\
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Mean Sea Level (MSL).

By definition, mean sea level is at geopotential altitude $H=0$, and at
geodetic altitude $h=0$. The pressure differs from the pressure $p_0$
under ISA conditions at sea level by a difference $\Delta p$. The
pressure altitude at mean sea level $H_{p,{\mathit{ \tiny MSL}}}$ is
obtained simply by replacing the geopotential altitude $H$ by the
pressure altitude $H_p$ in the first expression of @eq-GEOPOTENTIAL_ALTITUDE_ISA valid for the ISA atmosphere, and applying it to the troposphere by taking as a base the isobaric $p=p_0$.

$$\begin{aligned}
&p_{\mathit{ \tiny MSL}}= p_0 + \Delta p\\
&T_{\mathit{ \tiny MSL}}= T_0 + \Delta T + \beta H_{p,{\mathit{ \tiny MSL}}} =  T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA, MSL}} + \Delta T\\
&T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA, MSL}}= T_0 + \beta H_{p,{\mathit{ \tiny MSL}}}\\
&H_{p,{\mathit{ \tiny MSL}}} = \frac{T_0}{\beta}\left[\left(\frac{p_{\mathit{ \tiny MSL}}}{p_0}\right)^{\frac{g_0}{\beta R}} -1 \right]\\
&H_{\mathit{ \tiny MSL}} = 0\end{aligned}$$

### Relation between Geopotential and Pressure Altitudes

Combining @eq-FLUIDOSTATIC and @eq-PERFECT_GAS, we see that a variation in pressure $dp$ in
the non-ISA atmosphere corresponds to a variation in geopotential
altitude $dH$, according to the following @eq-DP_NON_ISA.

$$ dp= - \frac{p}{RT} g_0 dH
$$ {#eq-DP_NON_ISA}

The same variation of pressure in an ISA atmosphere would correspond to
a variation of pressure altitude $dH_p$, satisfying @eq-DP_ISA.

$$ dp= - \frac{p}{RT_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA}}} g_0 dH_P
$${#eq-DP_ISA}

Dividing the expression @eq-DP_NON_ISA by @eq-DP_ISA, we obtain the relation between geopotential altitude variation and pressure altitude variation, given by the following @eq-dH_dHp.

$$ \frac{dH}{dH_p}=\frac{T}{T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA}}}
$$ {#eq-dH_dHp}

The relation @eq-H_Hp between $H$ and $H_p$ is obtained by integrating
@eq-dH_dHp taking into
account @eq-TEMP_HP and @eq-TEMP_ISA_HP for the expression of the temperatures $T$ and $T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA}}$.

$$\begin{aligned}
&H= H_p - H_{p,\mathit{ \tiny MSL}} + \frac{\Delta T}{\beta} \ln \left(\frac{T_0+\beta H_p}{T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA,MSL}}}\right)& \quad\quad\text{for}\quad H_p<H_{p,\mathit{ trop}}\\
&H_{\text{trop}} = H_{p,\mathit{ trop}} - H_{p,\mathit{ \tiny MSL}} + \frac{\Delta T}{\beta} \ln \left(\frac{T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}}{T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA,MSL}}}\right)&\\
&H = H_{\text{trop}} + \frac{T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}}{T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA,MSL}}}(H_p - H_{p,\mathit{ trop}}) &  \quad\quad\text{for}\quad H_p \geq H_{p,\mathit{ trop}}\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-H_Hp}

where

$$\begin{aligned}
&H_{p,\mathit{ \tiny MSL}} = \frac{T_0}{\beta}\left[\left(\frac{p_{\mathit{ \tiny MSL}}}{p_0}\right)^{\frac{g_0}{\beta R}}-1\right]\\
&H_{p,\mathit{ trop}} = 11000\quad\text{m}\\
&T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA,MSL}} = T_0+ \beta H_{p,\mathit{ \tiny MSL}}\\
&T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop} = T_0+\beta H_{p,\mathit{ trop}}\\\end{aligned}
$$

### Pressure $p$ as a Function of Pressure Altitude $H_p$


@eq-PRESSURE_ISA can be transposed directly to the non-ISA
case, replacing $H$ by $H_p$ and $T$ by $T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA}}$. For
the troposphere and stratosphere, we then obtain the expressions given
in @eq-PRESSURE:

$$\begin{aligned}
&p =  p_0\left[\frac{T_0 + \beta H_p}{T_0}\right]^{- \frac{g_0}{R \beta}} & \quad\quad\text{for}\quad H_p<H_{p,\text{trop}}\\
&p_{\text{trop}}= p_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}= p_0\left[\frac{T_0 + \beta H_{p,\text{trop}}}{T_0}\right]^{- \frac{g_0}{R \beta}}&\\
&p =p_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop} \exp\left[- \frac{g_0}{R T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}}(H_p-H_{p,\text{trop}})\right]& \quad\quad\text{for}\quad H_p \geq H_{p,\text{trop}}\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-PRESSURE}

### Pressure Altitude $H_p$ as a Function of Pressure $p$

$$\begin{aligned}
&H_p=  \frac{T_0}{\beta}\left[\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right)^{- \frac{R \beta}{g_0}} -1\right] & \quad\quad\text{for}\quad p \geq p_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}\\
% \quad\quad\text{pour}\quad H_p<H_{p,\text{trop}}\\
& H_p = H_{p,\text{trop}} - \frac{R T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}}{g_0}\ln\left(\frac{p}{p_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}}\right)& \quad\quad\text{for}\quad p < p_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-Hp_PRESSURE}


with
$$p_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}= p_0\left[\frac{T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}}{T_0}\right]^{- \frac{g_0}{R \beta}}
 =p_0\left[\frac{T_0 + \beta H_{p,\text{trop}}}{T_0}\right]^{- \frac{g_0}{R \beta}}
 $$

### Air Density $\rho$ as a Function of Pressure Altitude $H_p$

$$\begin{aligned}
&\rho =  \frac{p_0}{T_0+\Delta T + \beta H_p}\left[\frac{T_0 + \beta H}{T_0}\right]^{- \frac{g_0}{R \beta}} & \quad\text{for}\quad H_p<H_{p,\text{trop}}\\
& \rho_{\text{trop}}= \frac{p_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}}{R(T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}+\Delta T)}&\\
& \rho = \frac{p_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}}{R(T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}+\Delta T)} \exp\left[- \frac{g_0}{R T_{\mathit{ \tiny ISA},trop}}(H_p-H_{p,\text{trop}})\right]& \quad\text{for}\quad H_p \geq H_{p,\text{trop}}\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-DENSITY}

### Speed of Sound

The speed of sound in the non-ISA atmosphere is given by
$a= \sqrt{\kappa RT}$ (@eq-SOUND_ISA), the temperature $T$ being given
by @eq-TEMP_HP.

[^1]: Note that the pressure altitude and geopotential altitude are the
    same, when the atmosphere is standard

#### Pressure Settings: QNH and QFE

<!-- TODO move to "Atmosphere model" (atmosphere.qmd) -->

Aircraft altimeters measure altitude by detecting atmospheric pressure changes, but require proper pressure reference settings for accurate readings.

**QNH** (Sea Level Pressure): When set to QNH, the altimeter displays altitude above mean sea level. This setting is required for en-route navigation and approach procedures, as published obstacle clearance altitudes and minimum safe altitudes are referenced to sea level. Aircraft use QNH during most phases of flight to ensure terrain and obstacle clearance.

**QFE** (Aerodrome Pressure): When set to QFE, the altimeter reads zero when the aircraft is on the aerodrome elevation. This setting is particularly useful during airport operations, as pilots can directly read their height above the runway. Some airports and regions prefer QFE for approach and landing procedures, especially where terrain varies significantly around the airport.

The difference between QNH and QFE equals the aerodrome elevation above sea level. For example, if an airport sits 1,000 feet above sea level, QFE will be lower than QNH by the pressure equivalent of that altitude difference. Pilots must ensure they use the correct pressure setting for their phase of flight and local procedures to maintain safe altitude references.
