To ensure safe and efficient air transportation, \acr{ATM} relies on infrastructure, services, and functions in the areas of \acr{CNS}. As such, communication enables the exchange of information, be it in spoken or written form, between crews of aircraft and/or air traffic control. Navigation encompasses all services and infrastructures by means of which aircraft crews find their way through space in order to get from one place to another quickly, efficiently, and safely. Finally, surveillance comprises all technical possibilities by means of which air traffic control can determine the position of aircraft. In the following, the most important services, technologies, and processes in the field of CNS are presented.

## Communication
### Voice communications
VHF, HF
AIREP

### Data communications
ACARS, Data Link

## Navigation
Navigation deals with the question of how aircraft, ships, cars, etc. can move from one place to another in a safe and efficient manner. In this context, the main question navigation is concerned with is how an aircraft, a ship or a car can determine its own position relative to a reference system.

In the past, rather simple and rudimentary methods were used for navigation. Using so-called dead-reckonin, the current position is determined based on a known prior position as well as the current direction and speed of movement. Furthermore, so-called celestial navigation was used, in which the current position is determined based on celestial measurements, i.e. by determining the position of celestial bodies in relation to an observer.

In aviation, the above-mentioned rudimentary methods of navigation can be employed as well. However, over the last century, a number of different, more advanced ways of determining the position of an aircraft have been developed, implemented, and applied. These navigation methods are usually based on infrastructures that are stationed either on land or in space. The most important navigation methods in aviation are described in detail below.


### Non-Directional Beacon (NDB)

### VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR)

- add picture of VOR ground station

:::

VOR stations were developped in the United States in the 1930s before being deployed after the Second World War. VOR are simple short-ranged ground stations using radio waves to allow any receiver locked on its frequency to determine its bearing with respect to the ground station.

A VOR ground station operates on line of sight (about 200 nautical miles). It uses a phased antenna array to send a strong omnidirectional signal on a determined frequency, serving as a reference for comparison with a highly directional signal rotating clockwise. The phase difference between the reference signal and the directional signal is the bearing from the VOR station to the receiver relative to magnetic north.

VOR stations are often collocated with DME (Distance Measuring Equipments) which measure the distance between an aircraft and a ground station, by timing the propagation delay of radio signals initiated by the airborne interrogator and replicated after a known delay. Again, precise clocks are key to a precise measurement of distances.

Today, VOR stations are being gradually decommissioned as navigation aids move to performance-based navigation.

##### Move to CNS/Navigation?
To establish these routes, the aviation system relies on a network of predefined **waypoints**, which can be either specific geographic locations determined by GPS coordinates, or **ground-based navigation aids** such as VORs (VHF Omnidirectional Range beacons). These waypoints form the foundation of structured air traffic routes.

Traditionally, sequences of waypoints are connected to form **airways**, the highways of the sky. Aircraft follow these established corridors as part of their flight plans, allowing controllers to manage traffic safely and predictably, especially in busy or constrained airspace. Aircraft navigate from one waypoint to the next, following a path that resembles a series of connected legs rather than a single straight line. Modern aircraft are usually equipped with [**\acr{FMS}**](aircraft.qmd#flight-control-systems) that can store and follow these predefined routes automatically, making it easier for both pilots and controllers to maintain accurate navigation.

To further organise traffic in and out of airports, two types of standardized routes are used:

- **Standard Instrument Departures (SID)** guide aircraft from an airport's runway to the en-route structure. These routes are designed to separate departures from each other and from arriving traffic.
- **Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STAR)** lead aircraft from the en-route phase back into the terminal area for landing. Like SIDs, they help manage traffic flow and reduce controller workload.

These procedures are published on aviation charts and are often required for flights operating under [**Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)**](#flight-rules), which govern most commercial and high-altitude air traffic.

**TODO**

- add an excerpt of route map
:::

VOR were traditionally used as intersections along airways. A typical airway will jump in non necessarily straight lines from one navigational point to
another. Typical navigational points can be defined as:

- a NDB (Non Directional Beacon, the ancestor of VOR), VOR or DME ground station;
- intersections between two radials from different VOR stations;
- a VOR radial and a DME distance.

Today, more navigational points are defined as simple GPS coordinates.

## Surveillance

### Radars

The fundamental theory of radar started in late 19th century. Since the 1860s, when the electromagnetic theory was discovered by [James Clerk Maxwell](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell), the foundation for many science and technology fields was laid out. In the late 19th century, [Heinrich Hertz](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz), who proved the existence of electromagnetic waves, also confirmed that metals could reflect radio waves. In the first decades of the 20th century, several systems for using radio waves to provide short-range directional information of objects were developed. German inventor [Christian HÃ¼lsmeyer](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_H%C3%BClsmeyer) is often considered as the first person to use radio waves to detect metal objects in 1904.

However, not until the Second World War, was the concept of RAdio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) developed. The technology was simultaneously researched by both major Allies and Axis countries. However, the United Kingdom led the race in developing a functional radar system.
