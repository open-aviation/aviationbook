A number of flight information is usually not directly accessible from settings recording aircraft trajectories. Metadata usually refers to any additional information enriching a trajectory.  Enriching trajectories with relevant information is usually a costly process, and access to such information can be complicated.

## ICAO identifiers

The most common identifier for aircraft in radar based technologies would be the identifier of the transponder: a **six-digit hexadecimal identifier**, i.e. an integer written in its hexadecimal form, which classically identifies an aircraft uniquely. In the remaining of the book, it is commonly referred as the *ICAO identifier*, or `icao24` in data records (24 standing for the number of bits encoding the integer).

Ranges of addresses are reserved per countries, who are free to assign addresses to aircraft registered by their authorities. All US registered aircraft get an address in the `0xa00000` to `0xafffff` range; in Europe, France gets `0x380000` to `0x3bffff`, Germany gets next interval from `0x3c0000` to `0x3fffff`, then the UK gets `0x400000` to `0x43ffff`, etc.

# Are ICAO addresses unique?

Yes and no. In practice, **for most short-term analyses**, we can consider the answer is yes.

However, an aircraft may get a different transponder identifier when she gets a different registration. This may happen when the aircraft is sold to new owners who want to register their aircraft in a different country. Then, after the aircraft gets a new registration, her old identifier can be reassigned to new aircraft.

Also, most aircraft manufacturers keep a small set of transponders that they reuse across many newborn aircraft for test flights. Those usually correspond to temporary registration numbers.

To sum up, it is safer to keep in mind that:

- the same aircraft can have different ICAO identifiers throughout her life;
- the same identifier can refer to different aircraft depending on the day we get data from her.

## Tail numbers

The tail number is the number usually written on the back side of the aircraft, like the license plate number of cars, but for aircraft. Tail numbers also follow a pattern per country: `F-` for France, `D-` for Germany, `G-` for the UK, with some recognised patterns for specific categories of aircraft. Every country is free to decide how to assign registrations to aircraft within their range, and to give them a tail number accordingly. In some countries, like the US, Japan or Korea, there is a direct correspondence between tail numbers and ICAO identifiers, but that's not the case in every country.

In the US, tail registrations start with the N letter (they are also called N-numbers) and are followed by up to 5 numbers, or up to 4 numbers and 1 letter, or 3 numbers and 2 letters. Letters I and O are excluded. Then there is a *"direct"* correspondence with transponder addresses: `0xa00001` for `N1`, `0xa00002` for `N1A`, `0xa00003` for `N1AA` then `0xa00004` for `N1AB` until `0xadf7c7` fort `N99999`.

# What is the PIA program?

To address privacy concerns, FAA has initiated the Privacy ICAO aircraft address (PIA) program to improve the privacy of the eligible US-registered aircraft, ADS-B equipped and flying in the domestic US airspace. Recent research @michel_pia_2021 have shown this attempt is vain as it is very easy to break the anonymization and find which PIA address (between N41000 `0xa4d691` and N42 `0xa4f946`) is associated to which aircraft.

@tbl-icao illustrates some examples of patterns in registrations numbers assigned by countries. In the Netherlands, KLM matches the two first letters after the country code to aircraft types.

| country | range |    | pattern | category |
| ------- | ----- | -- | ------  | -------- |
| **France** | `380000` | `3bffff` | F- | |
|     | | | F-A | Historic aircraft |
|     | | | F-C | Gliders |
|     | | | F-J | Ultralights |
|     | | | F-W | Test and Delivery |
|     | | | F-Z | State owned |
| **Switzerland** | `4b0000` | `4b7fff` | HB- | |
|     | | | HB-B | Balloons |
|     | | | HB-F | Produced in Switzerland |
|     | | | HB-X or Z | Helicopters |
| **The Netherlands** | `480000` | `487ffff` | PH- | |
|     | | | PH-AO | KLM Airbus A330 |
|     | | | PH-BH | KLM Boeing 787-9 |
|     | | | PH-BK | KLM Boeing 787-10 |
|     | | | PH-BQ | KLM Boeing 777-200 |

## Aircraft type designators

[*DOC 8643 - Aircraft Type Designators*](https://www.icao.int/publications/DOC8643/Pages/default.aspx) by ICAO contains designators for aircraft types which are most commonly provided with air traffic service (ATS).

Each designator consists of a 4-letter code associated with a manufacturer and an aircraft type, e.g., `A320` for Airbus A320, `B78X` for Boeing 787-10 or `E190` for Embraer 190. More specific designators can be used for balloons `BALL` or gliders `GLID`.

This designator is often referred as `typecode` in aircraft databases and helps associating an aircraft type to an ICAO identifier.

## Data sources

Maintaining a data base of transponder identifiers, aircraft tail numbers, type designators, owners and/or operators is a very cumbersome process. New aircraft are manufactured every month, which generates new transponder identifiers @opensky21. Some countries keep a database of their registered aircraft public (e.g. [FAA (US)](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/), [France](https://immat.aviation-civile.gouv.fr/immat/servlet/aeronef_liste.html), [Switzerland](https://app02.bazl.admin.ch/web/bazl/en/#/lfr/search) or [The Netherlands](https://www.ilent.nl/onderwerpen/luchtvaartuigregister#/)), but this is not a systematic practice in every country, and those do not always contain the transponder identifier.

There have also been some crowdsourcing effort to constitute and maintain aircraft databases based on various open records and entries on social networks. Such databases raise some privacy concerns among some aircraft owners, who may be tempted to vandalise those databases @astroturfing22.

Some public aircraft databases:

- [The OpenSky Network aircraft database](https://opensky-network.org/aircraft-database) contains several hundreds of thousands of airframes;
- [Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/data) give access to an interface to search for individual aircraft;
- The website [www.airframes.org](http://www.airframes.org/), but they are very strict about their [terms of use](http://www.airframes.org/about);
- Some Regional Monitoring Agencies (RMA) provide open access to data matching aircraft registered in their area, specifically in [Europe](https://www.eurocontrol.int/rmalive/regulatorListInit.do) or in the [Middle-East](https://midrma.com/en).
