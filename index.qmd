This is the website for the book "{{< meta title >}}", a project started by a team of [**four aviation enthusiasts**](authors.qmd), working in the field of aviation and sharing a common objective to share open knowledge about all what is available to analyse aviation data.

The purpose of this book is to

- recall **background knowledge** required to work with aviation data;
- present the most common **data sources**, API and formats;
- introduce computational frameworks that make it possible to **easily handle aviation related data**, with a focus on the Python, R and Observable languages;
- showcase **common data visualization frameworks** on usual applications;
- recommend **good practices to share new data, code and results**.
